# Introduction

* Traffic noise pollution in urban areas is a major environmental problem
* Creating an acceptable acoustic outdoor environment is a big challenge of high need
* Aircraft noise can cause annoyance and sleep disturbance
* Millions of people worldwide are affected by aircraft noise
* To obtain a more complete representation of annoyance, one should *predict the audible aircraft sound* and determine the impact of the aircraft sound on people
* Requires a tool for the synthesis or auralisation

# Development of auralisation tool

* Support typical urban situations where reflections may play an important role
* Model should be physically correct
* But more importantly, the auralisations should sound plausible
* Implementation:
    * Source synthesiser describes emission from jet, fan, airframe, etc.
    * Propagation model includes spherical spreading, Doppler shift, atmospheric absorption, reflections, fluctuations due to turbulence
* Fluctuations due to turbulence can be heard, and therefore need to be included.

# Atmospheric turbulence

* A *filter* is needed to apply fluctuations due to turbulence
* The wind velocity components and temperature in the turbulent atmosphere are fluctuating both in position and time.
    * Causes fluctuations in refractive-index $\mu$
    * Results in fluctuations of the received signal

* The theory of turbulence is a statistical theory
* For an auralisation instantaneous values of the sound pressure $p(t)$ at the receiver are required
    * Log-amplitude fluctuation $\chi(t) = \log{\left( \frac{A}{A_0}\right)}$ with $A = |p|$ and $A_0 = \langle A \rangle$
    * Phase fluctuation $S(t) = \phi - \phi_0$ with $\phi = \angle p$ and $\phi_0 = \langle \phi \rangle$

    
# Modelling atmospheric turbulence

* Turbulence spectrum

* Correlation $B(r) = \langle \mu_1  \mu_2 \rangle = \langle \mu^2 \rangle \exp{\left( -r^2 / L^2 \right)}$.
    * Gaussian spectrum
    * Variance of refractive-index $\langle \mu^2 \rangle$, distance $r$ and correlation length $L$
    * Isotropic and homogeneous.

* Variances of fluctuations $\langle \chi^2 \rangle = \langle S^2 \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \langle \mu^2 \rangle k^2 r L$
    * Mean squared log-amplitude fluctuation $\langle \chi^2 \rangle$
    * Mean phase fluctuation $\langle S^2 \rangle $
<!--* Covariances $B_{\chi} (\rho) = B_{S}(\rho) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}  \langle \mu^2  \rangle k^2 r L \frac{\Phi(\rho/L) }{\rho / L}$-->
* Covariances divided by variances $\frac{B_{\chi}}{\langle \chi^2 \rangle} =  \frac{B_{S}}{\langle S^2 \rangle} = \frac{\Phi(\rho/L) }{\rho / L}$
<!--     * Karavainikov, 1957. -->
    * Spherical waves
    * Valid when Fresnel zone much large than the correlation length $\sqrt{\lambda r} \gg L$
    * Wavenumber $k$, spatial separation perpendicular to wave direction $\rho$ and error function $\Phi$

    
<!-- * Log-amplitude fluctuation $\chi(t) = A(t) / \overline{A(t)}$ -->
<!-- * Phase fluctuation $S(t)$ -->

# Calculating time series of fluctuations

Consider a single propagation path and a pure tone:

1. Sample the normalised covariance $B_{\chi} (\rho) = B_{S}(\rho) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}  \langle \mu^2  \rangle k^2 r L \frac{\Phi(\rho/L) }{\rho / L}$
2. Determine spatial impulse response $h(\rho)$ from $B_{\chi} (\rho) = B_{S}(\rho)$
3. Generate two series of random numbers, for amplitude and phase
4. Convolution of $h(\rho)$ with random numbers results in $\chi(t)$ and $S(t)$

# Applying fluctuations to signal

* Apply the fluctuations $\chi(t,f)$ and $S(t,f)$ to a signal $x(t)$ resulting in modulated signal $y(t)$:

* Two methods:
    * Slow method: 
        1. Decompose $x(t)$ in pure tones using DFT and apply (unique) modulation to each tone
        2. $y(t) = \sum\limits_{f=0}^N  \left\{ |X(f)|  \cdot e^{\chi(t,f)} \cdot \sin{\left( 2\pi f t + \angle X(f) + S(t,f) \right)} \right\}$
    * Faster method, but different operation:
        1. Decompose $x(t)$ using bandpass filters
        2. Convert phase in radians to delay in seconds: $d = \frac{\phi}{2 \pi f}$
        3. Use a variable delay line to apply the phase modulation and a simple multiplication for the amplitude modulations
* Methods are different, but both give a plausible result

# Log-amplitude saturation

* For longer path lengths and stronger turbulence, the amplitude fluctuations gradually level off. 
* Saturation can be observed when measuring aircraft noise at distances of over a few kilometers. 
* The standard deviation of the fluctuating sound pressure levels is then limited to approximately 6 dB. 
* Can be accounted for by multiplying $\chi(t,f)$ with $\sqrt{ \frac{ 1}{1 + r/r_s}}$.
    * With saturation distance $r_s(f)$ according to Wenzel, 1976.
    * $r_s = \frac{1}{2 \langle \mu^2 \rangle k^2 L}$

    
# Variances of fluctuations

\centering\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../figures/function_of_frequency}

$\mathbb{E} \left[ \chi^2 \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ S^2 \right] = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \langle \mu^2 \rangle k^2 r L$
    
# Variances of fluctuations including saturation

\centering\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../figures/function_of_frequency_with_saturation}
  
$\mathbb{E} \left[ S^2 \right] = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \langle \mu^2 \rangle k^2 r L \qquad \mathbb{E} \left[ \chi^2 \right] = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \langle \mu^2 \rangle k^2 r L \cdot \frac{ 1}{1 + r/r_s}$


# Example: Auralisation of aircraft noise

* Unique time series of fluctuations applied to each third-octave band.
    * Same 'random' numbers, but frequency-dependent correlation $B$

# Conclusion

Conclusions:

* Possible to generate time series of amplitude and phase fluctuations due to propagation in a turbulent atmosphere
* Use common parameters
    * Outer length scale of turbulence $L$
    * Mean squared refractive-index $\langle \mu^2 \rangle$, which is based on variances in windspeed and temperature
* Results in more realistic auralisations

Future work:

* Replace Gaussian spectrum with Von Karman spectrum (Ostashev, 1998)
* Height-dependent correlation length
